## 1. Summary

This was a high-priority MVP item that involved creating a dedicated dashboard for tenants to view their rent payment history and manage their account settings. This work enhances the tenant experience and provides essential self-service capabilities.

## 2. Detailed Work Completed

### A. API Endpoint Development

-   **Tenant Rent Payments API (`app/api/tenants/me/rent-payments/route.ts`):**
    -   Created a new API route to fetch the rent payment history for the currently logged-in tenant.
    -   The `GET` handler retrieves all rent payments associated with the tenant, including property details for context.
-   **Tenant Profile API (`app/api/tenants/me/route.ts`):**
    -   Implemented a `PATCH` handler to allow tenants to update their personal information.
    -   The handler updates both the `User` and `Tenant` models in a single transaction to ensure data consistency.

### B. Frontend Development

-   **Rent Payment History Component (`components/tenants/RentPaymentHistory.tsx`):**
    -   Developed a component to display a tenant's rent payment history in a clear and organized table.
    -   The component fetches data from the new API endpoint and formats it for easy viewing.
-   **Account Settings Component (`components/tenants/AccountSettings.tsx`):**
    -   Created a component with a form for tenants to update their name, email, and phone number.
    -   The component includes form validation and provides user feedback on the success or failure of the update.
-   **Tenant Dashboard Page (`app/dashboard/tenant/page.tsx`):**
    -   Created a new, dedicated dashboard page for tenants.
    -   The page uses a tabbed interface to provide access to the 'Rent Payments' and 'Account Settings' sections, integrating the new components into a seamless user experience.
