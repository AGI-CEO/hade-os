# Progress Report

**Feature Implemented:** Enhanced Financial Tracking

---

## 1. Summary

This report details the work completed for the "Enhanced Financial Tracking" feature, a high-priority item from the MVP requirements. This implementation provides landlords with the tools to manage income and expenses for their properties, a core component of the HADE OS platform.

The work involved a significant database schema refactoring to create a more robust and scalable financial data model, the development of a comprehensive set of API endpoints for transaction and category management, and the creation of a new frontend dashboard for a seamless user experience.

## 2. Detailed Work Completed

### A. Database Schema Refactoring (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

- **Unified Transaction Model:** The existing `Income` and `Expense` models were deprecated and replaced with a single, more versatile `Transaction` model. This new model includes a `type` field (`INCOME` or `EXPENSE`) to differentiate between the two, simplifying data management.
- **New `FinancialCategory` Model:** A new `FinancialCategory` model was introduced to provide structured and queryable categorization for transactions. This replaces the previous string-based category fields.
- **Database Migration:** A destructive database migration was created to remove the old tables and establish the new schema. This was a necessary step to improve the data architecture for this critical feature.

### B. API Endpoint Development (`app/api/`)

- **Transactions API (`app/api/transactions/`):**
  - Created `route.ts` with `GET` and `POST` handlers to list all transactions for a specific property and create new transactions.
  - Created a dynamic route `[id]/route.ts` with `PATCH` and `DELETE` handlers for updating and deleting individual transactions.
- **Categories API (`app/api/categories/route.ts`):**
  - Created a new route with a `GET` handler to fetch all available financial categories, allowing for dynamic category selection in the frontend.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** All endpoints are protected and verify that the user has ownership of the associated property before performing any operations.

### C. New Component: Financials Dashboard (`components/financials/FinancialsDashboard.tsx`)

- **Component Creation:** A new, self-contained React component was developed to handle all financial management functionality for a property.
- **Features:**
  - **Financial Summary:** Displays a clear overview of total income, total expenses, and net profit.
  - **Transaction Table:** Lists all transactions with details, including date, type, category, description, and amount.
  - **Transaction Form:** A dialog-based form allows for the creation and editing of transactions, with fields for type, category, date, amount, and description.
  - **Deletion Confirmation:** A confirmation dialog is used to prevent accidental deletion of transactions.
  - **API Integration:** The component communicates directly with the new API endpoints to fetch, create, update, and delete financial data.

### D. Integration with Property Details Page

- **Component Integration:** The new `FinancialsDashboard` component was integrated into the property details page (`app/dashboard/properties/[propertyId]/page.tsx`).
- **Seamless UX:** It is displayed as a dedicated section on the page, providing a comprehensive financial overview directly within the context of the property.

## 3. Next Steps

With the core functionality for "Enhanced Financial Tracking" now complete, the next step is to address any remaining high-priority MVP features. The project documentation will be updated to reflect the completion of this feature.
