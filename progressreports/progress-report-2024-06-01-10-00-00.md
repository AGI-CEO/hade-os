# Progress Report

**Feature Implemented:** Property Image Upload and Management (Frontend)

---

## 1. Summary

This report outlines the work completed to implement the frontend functionality for the "Property Image Upload and Management" feature. This work follows the completion of the backend APIs and provides the user interface for landlords to manage their property images, as specified in the HADE OS Product Requirements Document (PRD).

The implementation involved a significant refactoring of the property dashboard to support dedicated detail pages, the creation of a comprehensive image management component, and the integration of this component to provide a seamless user experience for uploading, viewing, and deleting property images.

## 2. Detailed Work Completed

### A. Codebase Refactoring: Dynamic Property Routes

- **From Single-Page to Multi-Page Architecture:** The existing property dashboard (`components/property-dashboard.tsx`) was refactored from a single-page, master-detail interface into a list-based view.
- **New Dynamic Route:** A new dynamic route was created at `app/dashboard/properties/[propertyId]/page.tsx` to serve as a dedicated details page for each individual property. This improves scalability and user experience.
- **Updated Navigation:** The property cards in the main dashboard now use `<Link>` from `next/link` to navigate to their corresponding detail page, replacing the previous in-page modal view.

### B. New Component: Property Details Page (`app/dashboard/properties/[propertyId]/page.tsx`)

- **Page Creation:** A new page component was built to fetch and display detailed information for a single property based on the `propertyId` from the URL.
- **Data Fetching:** The page fetches all relevant property data, including the list of associated images, from the `/api/properties/[propertyId]` endpoint.
- **Layout:** It features a two-column layout, with the left column dedicated to image management and the right column displaying core property attributes.

### C. New Component: Image Manager (`components/properties/PropertyImageManager.tsx`)

- **Component Creation:** A new, self-contained React component was developed to handle all image-related functionality.
- **Features:**
  - **Image Gallery:** Displays the primary image prominently, followed by a grid of additional images.
  - **Image Upload:** Includes a form for uploading new images with support for `altText` metadata and a checkbox to set an image as primary upon upload. It provides visual feedback during the upload process.
  - **Image Deletion:** Allows users to delete any non-primary image. A confirmation dialog is used to prevent accidental deletions.
  - **API Integration:** The component communicates directly with the `POST` and `DELETE` API endpoints for property images.

### D. Integration and State Management

- **Component Integration:** The `PropertyImageManager` component was integrated into the new property details page.
- **Data Synchronization:** A callback function (`onImageUpdate`) is passed from the details page to the `PropertyImageManager`. This function re-fetches the property's data whenever an image is uploaded or deleted, ensuring the UI always reflects the current state of the database without a full page reload.

## 3. Next Steps

With the "Property Image Upload and Management" feature now complete on both the backend and frontend, the next step is to move to the next high-priority feature outlined in the project roadmap. The project documentation will now be updated to reflect this completion.
