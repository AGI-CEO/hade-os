# Progress Report

**Date:** 2024-05-31-18-00-00
**Feature Implemented:** Property Image Upload and Management (Backend)

---

## 1. Summary

This report outlines the work completed to implement the backend functionality for the "Property Image Upload and Management" feature, as defined in the HADE OS Product Requirements Document (PRD). This feature allows landlords to upload, view, and delete images for their properties, a crucial step in making property listings more comprehensive and appealing.

The implementation involved updating the database schema, creating new storage solutions, developing a suite of API endpoints to handle the business logic, and updating the project's status documentation.

## 2. Detailed Work Completed

### A. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

- **New `PropertyImage` Model:** A new model was added to the schema to store metadata for each uploaded image.
  - **Fields:** `id`, `imageUrl` (public URL), `storagePath` (internal path for deletions), `altText`, `isPrimary`, `uploadedAt`, `updatedAt`.
  - **Relations:** A one-to-many relationship was established between the `Property` and `PropertyImage` models. The `onDelete: Cascade` rule ensures that when a property is deleted, all its associated images are also removed from the database.
- **Updated `Property` Model:** The `Property` model was updated to include a `propertyImages` field, representing the new relation.

### B. Database Migration & Client Generation

- **Migrations:** Two new database migrations were generated and applied to sync the PostgreSQL database with the new schema changes.
- **Prisma Client:** The Prisma Client was regenerated (`bunx prisma generate`) to ensure that the new `PropertyImage` model and its relationships were available for use in the application's backend code.

### C. Supabase Storage (`lib/supabase-storage.ts`)

- **New Storage Bucket:** A new public storage bucket named `hade-property-images` was designated for storing all property-related images.
- **Refactored Storage Utilities:** The core file operation functions (`uploadFile`, `deleteFile`, `getFileUrl`) were refactored to be more generic. They now accept a `bucketName` parameter, making them reusable for both the existing private `hade-documents` bucket and the new public `hade-property-images` bucket.
- **Storage Initialization:** The `initializeStorage` function was updated to ensure that both storage buckets are created if they do not already exist when the application starts.

### D. Backend API Routes

New API endpoints were created to provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Delete) functionality for property images.

- **`POST /api/properties/[propertyId]/images`** (Image Upload)

  - Handles multi-part form data containing the image file and optional metadata (`altText`, `isPrimary`).
  - Verifies that the request is made by an authenticated landlord who owns the specified property.
  - Uploads the image file to the `hade-property-images` Supabase bucket.
  - Creates a new `PropertyImage` record in the database, linking it to the property and storing both the public `imageUrl` and the internal `storagePath`.
  - Manages the `isPrimary` flag, ensuring only one image can be primary per property.

- **`GET /api/properties/[propertyId]/images`** (Image Listing)

  - Fetches all `PropertyImage` records associated with a specific property.
  - Returns the images sorted with the `isPrimary` image appearing first.

- **`DELETE /api/properties/[propertyId]/images/[imageId]`** (Image Deletion)
  - Verifies landlord ownership of the property.
  - Deletes the image file from Supabase Storage using the `storagePath` stored in the database.
  - Deletes the `PropertyImage` record from the database.
  - If the deleted image was the primary one, it intelligently assigns the primary status to the most recently uploaded remaining image.

### E. Project Documentation (`PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md`)

- The project roadmap was updated to mark the backend portion of the "Property image upload and management" feature as complete. A note was added to indicate that the corresponding frontend work is now pending.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next step is to develop the frontend components that will consume these new backend APIs. This includes building the user interface for:

- Viewing a gallery of property images on the property details page.
- Uploading new images via a form.
- Deleting existing images from the gallery.
- Potentially setting a primary image from the gallery view.
