# Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-06-09
**Feature Implemented:** Rent and Lease Management - Rent Payment Tracking

---

## 1. Summary

This report details the implementation of the "Rent Payment Tracking" feature, a critical component of the "Rent and Lease Management" module. This feature provides landlords with a comprehensive system to automatically track and manage rent payments throughout the lifecycle of a lease, significantly improving financial oversight and reducing administrative work.

The implementation involved modifications to the database schema, the creation of several new API endpoints for managing rent payments, the development of a utility function for generating payment schedules, and the integration of a new "Rent Payments" tab into the lease details page.

## 2. Detailed Work Completed

### A. Database Schema Enhancement (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

- **Refined `RentPayment` Model:** The existing `RentPayment` model was updated to better align with the feature requirements. Key fields were renamed for clarity (`amount` to `amountDue`, `date` to `dueDate`), and a `RentPaymentStatus` enum (`UPCOMING`, `UNPAID`, `PAID`, `LATE`) was introduced to enforce data integrity.
- **Relational Integrity:** The `RentPayment` model was linked to the `Lease` and `Transaction` models, ensuring that each payment is tied to a specific lease and that a corresponding financial transaction is created when a payment is recorded.

### B. Backend API Development

- **Rent Payment Generation (`lib/rent-payments.ts`):**
  - Created a new utility function, `generateRentPaymentsForLease`, which automatically generates the full schedule of `RentPayment` entries for a lease's term. This function is triggered when a lease's status is set to "active."
- **Lease Activation Hook (`app/api/leases/[id]/route.ts`):**
  - Modified the `PUT` handler for updating leases to call the `generateRentPaymentsForLease` function when a lease is activated. This ensures that the rent payment schedule is created at the appropriate time.
- **Rent Payments API (`app/api/leases/[leaseId]/rent-payments/route.ts`):**
  - Implemented a `GET` handler to fetch all rent payments for a specific lease. This endpoint also dynamically updates the status of payments from `UPCOMING` to `UNPAID` or `LATE` based on the current date, ensuring the data is always up-to-date.
- **Record Payment API (`app/api/rent-payments/[rentPaymentId]/record-payment/route.ts`):**
  - Created a `POST` handler that allows landlords to record a rent payment. This endpoint creates an `INCOME` transaction and updates the status of the `RentPayment` to `PAID`.

### C. Frontend Component Development

- **`LeaseViewer` Enhancement (`components/lease-viewer.tsx`):**
  - Integrated a `Tabs` component into the lease details page, creating two distinct sections: "Lease Agreement" and "Rent Payments."
- **`RentPaymentsTab` Component (`components/rent-payments-tab.tsx`):**
  - Developed a new component to display the rent payment schedule in a clear and organized table.
  - The table includes columns for the due date, amount due, status (with color-coded badges), and payment date.
  - A "Record Payment" button is displayed for any payments that are "UNPAID" or "LATE."
- **`RecordPaymentDialog` Component (`components/record-payment-dialog.tsx`):**
  - Created a dialog-based form for recording rent payments.
  - The form allows landlords to input the payment amount, date, and category, and it fetches available income categories from the API.
  - The dialog handles the API call to record the payment and provides feedback to the user via toast notifications.

## 3. Next Steps

With the core functionality for "Rent Payment Tracking" now complete, the next steps will involve further refinement of the user interface and the addition of related features, such as automated reminders for upcoming and overdue payments. The project documentation will be updated to reflect the completion of this feature.
