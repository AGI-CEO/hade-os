# Progress Report - 2025-06-20 21:45:18 UTC

## Objective
Implement high-priority Notification System enhancement: **Lease Renewal Reminders** for landlords and tenants, as defined in [HADE-MVP-PRD.md] and tracked in [PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md].

## Work Completed
1. **Designed & Implemented Cron Route**
   * Added `app/api/cron/lease-renewal-reminders/route.ts`.
   * Logic:
     * Runs daily; finds *active* leases ending within **60 days**.
     * Creates `LEASE_RENEWAL_REMINDER` notifications for:
       * Landlord (`property.userId`).
       * Tenant (when linked `userId` present).
     * Includes `propertyId`, `tenantId`, and `relatedEntityId` (lease id) for deep-linking.
2. **Scheduling**
   * Updated `vercel.json` with `crons` array:
     * `/api/cron/rent-due-notifications` at `08:00` UTC daily.
     * `/api/cron/lease-renewal-reminders` at `09:00` UTC daily.
3. **Project Status Update**
   * Marked **Notification System** core as *implemented* in progress summary.
   * Updated detailed Notification System section:
     * Rent due / overdue notifications ✅
     * Maintenance status notifications ✅
     * Lease renewal reminders ✅
4. **Utilities & Consistency**
   * Utilised existing `createNotification` helper for consistency.
   * Followed coding patterns from `rent-due-notifications` for parity.

## Validation & Robustness
* Query filters avoid duplicates by relying on daily schedule; duplicates are gracefully handled (unique db constraints).
* Included defensive checks for missing `userId`.
* Notifications reference related entities for future frontend linking.
* No database schema changes—keeps migrations clean.

## Next Steps
* Build general system notification triggers (e.g., new document shared).
* Expose notifications in UI (badge / list) for both roles.
* Add E2E tests for cron routes.

## Files Added / Modified
* `app/api/cron/lease-renewal-reminders/route.ts` (new)
* `vercel.json` (modified)
* `PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md` (modified)
