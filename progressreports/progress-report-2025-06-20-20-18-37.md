# Progress Report - 2025-06-20 20:18:37 UTC

## Objective
Implement high-priority **Frontend Notification System** to complete the notification system MVP requirement as defined in [HADE-MVP-PRD.md] Section 4.5 and tracked in [PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md]. This feature replaces the static notification dropdown with a complete, live notification system.

## Work Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Notification Dropdown Component
* **Created `components/notifications-dropdown.tsx`**:
  * **Live Data Integration**: Fetches real notifications from `/api/notifications` endpoint
  * **Real-time Updates**: 30-second polling to refresh notifications automatically
  * **Unread Badge**: Dynamic badge showing unread notification count (99+ for large numbers)
  * **Type-specific Icons**: Different icons for each notification type (rent, maintenance, lease, documents)
  * **Color-coded Notifications**: Visual distinction with border colors based on notification type
  * **Smart Navigation**: Clicking notifications navigates to relevant pages based on type and context
  * **Mark as Read**: Automatic and manual marking of notifications as read
  * **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling
  * **Animation Effects**: Smooth animations using Framer Motion for better UX

### 2. Notification Type System
* **Comprehensive Icon Mapping**:
  * `RENT_DUE`/`RENT_OVERDUE`: DollarSign icon with green color
  * `MAINTENANCE_STATUS_UPDATE`/`MAINTENANCE_NEW_REQUEST`: AlertTriangle icon with blue color
  * `LEASE_RENEWAL_REMINDER`: Calendar icon with amber color
  * `NEW_DOCUMENT_SHARED`: FileText icon with purple color
  * `GENERAL_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`: MessageSquare icon with gray color

* **Color-coded Visual System**:
  * Border colors and background tints for each notification type
  * Dark mode compatibility with appropriate color schemes
  * Unread notifications highlighted with accent styling

### 3. Smart Navigation System
* **Context-aware Routing**: Notifications navigate to appropriate pages based on:
  * User type (landlord vs tenant)
  * Notification type and related entity
  * Related entity IDs for deep linking
* **Navigation Mapping**:
  * Maintenance requests → `/dashboard/maintenance/[id]` or `/connect/maintenance`
  * Rent payments → `/dashboard/finances` or `/connect/pay-rent`
  * Lease renewals → `/dashboard/leases` or `/connect/lease`
  * Property-related → `/dashboard/properties/[propertyId]`

### 4. Dedicated Notifications Page
* **Created `app/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx`**:
  * **Full-featured Notification Center**: Complete page for managing all notifications
  * **Search and Filtering**: Search by content and filter by notification type or read status
  * **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple notifications and mark as read
  * **Advanced UI Components**: Checkboxes, dropdown menus, search inputs
  * **Detailed Information**: Shows both relative time ("2 hours ago") and absolute timestamps
  * **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices
  * **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no notifications are found

### 5. Enhanced Top Bar Integration
* **Updated `components/top-bar.tsx`**:
  * Replaced static notification dropdown with live `NotificationsDropdown` component
  * Removed hardcoded notification count and placeholder data
  * Integrated with new notification system architecture
  * Maintained consistent design and user experience

### 6. Document Sharing Notification Integration
* **Enhanced `app/api/documents/share/route.ts`**:
  * **Automatic Notifications**: When documents are shared, automatically creates `NEW_DOCUMENT_SHARED` notifications
  * **Multi-tenant Support**: Notifies all tenants with user accounts for the property
  * **Rich Context**: Includes document name, property information, and proper entity relationships
  * **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling for notification creation

### 7. Notification API Integration
* **Leveraged Existing APIs**:
  * `GET /api/notifications`: Fetch user's notifications
  * `PATCH /api/notifications/[id]/read`: Mark individual notifications as read
  * Full integration with existing notification infrastructure

### 8. Testing and Validation System
* **Created `scripts/test-notifications.js`**:
  * **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Creates sample notifications of all types
  * **Data Validation**: Verifies notification creation and database storage
  * **Statistics Reporting**: Shows notification counts and recent activity
  * **User-friendly Output**: Clear console output with emojis and formatting
  * **Real-world Test Data**: Creates realistic notification scenarios
