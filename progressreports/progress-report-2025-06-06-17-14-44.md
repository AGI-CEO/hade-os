**Feature Implemented:** Maintenance Request System Improvements

---

## 1. Summary

This report details the work completed for the 'Maintenance Request System Improvements' feature. This was a high-priority MVP item that involved significant enhancements to the backend API, a database schema update, and the creation of a new, dedicated frontend interface for managing maintenance requests and communicating with tenants.

---

## 2. Detailed Work Completed

### A. Database Schema Refactoring (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

-   **Manual Vendor Fields:** To simplify the MVP, the `MaintenanceRequest` model was updated to include `vendorName` and `vendorContact` fields, removing the previous relationship to a dedicated `Vendor` model. This allows landlords to manually enter vendor information.
-   **Message-User Relation:** A two-way relationship was established between the `MaintenanceMessage` and `User` models to properly track the sender of each message.
-   **Database Migration:** A new database migration was created to apply these changes.

### B. API Endpoint Development

-   **Consolidated Maintenance API (`app/api/maintenance/[id]/route.ts`):**
    -   Created a new, RESTful API route to handle all actions for a single maintenance request.
    -   Implemented `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` handlers for fetching, updating, and deleting individual requests.
    -   All handlers include authorization to ensure only property owners can perform actions.
-   **Messaging API (`app/api/maintenance/[id]/messages/route.ts`):**
    -   Created a new route to handle messaging for a maintenance request.
    -   Implemented a `POST` handler to create new messages, associating them with the current user.
    -   Authorization is in place to ensure only authorized users can post messages.

### C. Frontend Development

-   **Maintenance Request Detail Page (`app/dashboard/maintenance/[id]/page.tsx`):**
    -   Created a new, dedicated page to display the full details of a single maintenance request.
    -   The page fetches data from the new API endpoints and displays all relevant information, including status, cost, and vendor details.
-   **Messaging Component (`components/maintenance/Messaging.tsx`):**
    -   Developed a reusable React component for handling real-time messaging.
    -   The component displays the conversation history in a chat-like format and includes a form for sending new messages.
    -   It features optimistic UI updates for a seamless user experience.
-   **Integration:** The `Messaging` component was integrated into the detail page, providing a complete interface for managing maintenance requests.
