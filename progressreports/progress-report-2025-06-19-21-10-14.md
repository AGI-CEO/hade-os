# Progress Report - 2025-06-19 21:10:14

## Objective
Resolve Next.js build error: "different slug names for the same dynamic path ('id' !== 'leaseId')" occurring during deployment.

## Root Cause
The `app/api/leases` API layer had two dynamic route segments for the same path level:

* `app/api/leases/[id]/route.ts`
* `app/api/leases/[leaseId]/rent-payments/route.ts`

Next.js treats these as conflicting because both map to `/api/leases/:param` but with differing param names.

## Fix Implemented
1. **Unified dynamic segment name to `id`**  
   • Created new file `app/api/leases/[id]/rent-payments/route.ts` with identical logic, modified to read `params.id`.  
   • Added explicit `any` typings to resolve implicit-any lint warnings.
2. **Removed conflicting file**  
   • Deleted `app/api/leases/[leaseId]/rent-payments/route.ts` (and empty directory left behind).
3. **No public API change** – endpoint remains `/api/leases/{id}/rent-payments`.

## Validation
* Local dev build (`next build`) completes without slug conflict.  
* Manual call to `/api/leases/{id}/rent-payments` returns expected JSON.

## Next Steps
* Search for any imports that relied on `leaseId` param inside API route; none found.  
* Consider renaming dashboard front-end paths to use consistent `[id]` segment, but not required for build.
