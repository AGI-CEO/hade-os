## Objective
Implement high-priority Notification System enhancement: Maintenance Request Notifications (new requests and status updates), as outlined in PRD §4.3.2 and Project Status & Roadmap §II-A-2 (Phase 2 specific notification logic).

## Work Completed
1. **Created reusable notification helper**  
   • **File:** `lib/notifications.ts`  
   • Exports `createNotification` to encapsulate creation of `Notification` records using Prisma.
2. **Implemented notifications on maintenance request creation**  
   • **File:** `app/api/maintenance-requests/route.ts`  
   • Logic:  
     – When a *tenant* creates a request → landlord receives `MAINTENANCE_NEW_REQUEST` notification.  
     – When a *landlord* creates a request → linked tenants receive notification.  
3. **Implemented notifications on maintenance status update**  
   • **File:** `app/api/maintenance/[id]/route.ts`  
   • When status changes, all tenant users for the property receive `MAINTENANCE_STATUS_UPDATE` notification.
4. **Utility typing & error handling** added for robustness, with fallback logging if notification creation fails.

## Testing
Manual API tests executed via REST client:
• Created maintenance request as tenant → landlord notification created.  
• Updated status as landlord → tenant notifications created.  
Database verified via Prisma Studio; API `GET /api/notifications` returns expected objects.

## Next Steps
• Surface unread notification count in UI.  
• Add real-time delivery via websockets or polling.  
• Extend notification coverage (rent due, lease renewal).  
• Unit tests for `lib/notifications.ts`.
