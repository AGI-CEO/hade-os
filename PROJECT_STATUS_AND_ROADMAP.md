_ âœ… `Notification` data model added to `prisma/schema.prisma` (includes `id`, `userId`, `user` relation, `message`, `type` (enum `NotificationType`), `relatedEntityType`, `relatedEntityId`, `isRead`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
_ âœ… `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` updated with `notifications Notification[]` relation.
_ âœ… API route `app/api/notifications/route.ts` created with `GET` handler to fetch user's notifications.
_ âœ… API route `app/api/notifications/[notificationId]/read/route.ts` created with `PATCH` handler to mark notifications as read.
_ **Phase 2 (Specific Notification Logic - To Do / In Progress):**
_ ðŸ”„ Implement rent due notifications for tenants and landlords (requires background job/scheduler and integration with lease/payment data).
_ ðŸ”„ Develop notifications for maintenance request status updates (requires integration with maintenance module logic).
_ ðŸ”„ Implement lease renewal reminders for landlords (requires background job/scheduler and integration with lease data).
_ ðŸ”„ Create a general system notification framework for other alerts (e.g., new document shared, triggered by respective modules).
