# Important Next Steps

Before you can use Prisma with Supabase, you need to complete these steps:

## 1. Create the Prisma User in Supabase

The error message indicates that the 'prisma' user doesn't exist in the database yet. You need to:

1. Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to the SQL Editor
4. Create a new query
5. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/create-prisma-user.sql`
6. Run the query

This will create a user named `prisma`. Make sure to replace the placeholder password in the SQL script with a strong, secure password of your own.

## 2. Run Migrations

After creating the user, you can run the migrations:

```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## 3. Generate Prisma Client

After running migrations, generate the Prisma client:

```bash
bun run prisma:generate
```

## 4. Test the Connection

You can test the connection with:

```bash
bun run db:test-connection
```

## 5. Start Using Prisma in Your Application

Once everything is set up, you can start using Prisma in your application code.

For more detailed instructions, see the `README-PRISMA-SETUP.md` file.
